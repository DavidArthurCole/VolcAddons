**Before you begin, make sure you have these installed:**

1. **Install Forge:** Ensure that you have [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html) installed to enable mod compatibility.

2. **Install ChatTriggers:** You'll need [ChatTriggers](https://www.chattriggers.com) installed for advanced in-game functionality.

**Forge Installation:**
1. Download: Download the [VolcAddons-1.0.jar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhenga8533/VolcAddons/main/forge/VolcAddons-1.0.jar) file.

2. Integration: Drag into Minecraft mods folder (NOT CT modules folder).

3. El Fin v1: You should be good to go! The mod will alert you if there is ever a new release in which you can just run /updateva!

**Manual Installation:**
1. Download: Get the zip file, available either on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ftxB4kG2tw) or through [GitHub Releases](github.com/zhenga8533/VolcAddons/releases/latest).

2. Unzip: Extract the downloaded zip file. You should now see a folder named "VolcAddons".

3. Accessing ChatTriggers: Launch Minecraft and enter the command /ct files (you can also find this by going into ChatTriggers through the Minecraft configs path)

4. Integration: Return to the unzipped folder.

5. Module Replacement: Drag the VolcAddons folder into the "modules" folder.

6. Confirmation: If a pop-up appears, select "replace".
